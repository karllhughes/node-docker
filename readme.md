# Node Twitter Docker

This project was specifically branched off the wonderful [Node Twitter](https://github.com/vinitkumar/node-twitter) 
project for use as a part of a workshop designed to teach Node/Javascript developers about Docker.

By the end of this tutorial, you should have a working Twitter clone:

You can support the original project (Node Twitter) here: https://opencollective.com/node-twitter

## Prerequisites

You are required to have Docker installed if you'd like to run the app locally.

- Docker for Mac: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac
- Docker for Windows: https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows
- Docker for Linux: https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/

You should also have access to a terminal (bash preferred) and text editor. While not 
necessarily required, some familiarity with Javascript and Node will be helpful.

## Getting Started

Clone this repository (or fork it into your Github account and then clone it): `git clone https://github.com/karllhughes/node-twitter-docker`

Switch to the branch you'd like to start learning from. The lessons are numbered, so if you're brand new to Docker,
I'd recommend starting with the first one.

Follow the instructions on that branch's `readme.md` file.
